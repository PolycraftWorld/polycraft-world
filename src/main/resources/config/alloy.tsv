Otherwise, they will have to make do with galvanised or stainless steel materials such as nails, screws, tools, cutlery, steel wool, ball bearings, steel girders and steel wire. Due to the variety of steel types, carboncontent will widely vary and can contain many other elements such as Nickel,Vanadium, Chromium, Silicon, Boron,Zinc, Aluminium, Titanium, Manganese,Tungsten; these alloys all have different names and are sporadically available in different areas and retailers.
